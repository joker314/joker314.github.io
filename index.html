      <h1>CSRF in Scratch's Cloud Logs</h1>
      <p>Scratch keeps a log of modifications to cloud variables in a "Cloud Log" for each project. This is done, in part, to prevent users from changing cloud variables to inappropriate values. I found a Cross-Site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability which allowed me to modify a cloud variable impersonating the currently logged in user inside the Cloud Logs, with the only information needed for the attack being the victim's username.</p>
      <p>The CSRF attack required the user to open an attacker's page and the attacker could set a cloud variable to any value.</p>
      <p>The Scratch Team were speedy and transparent in resolving the vulnerability.</p>
