    <h1>joker314. write-ups.</h1>
    <p>Hi. I'm a 14 year old security researcher. Pick a vulnerability below to find its write-up</p>
    <p>Pick a write-up to view it</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./posts/scratch-xss.html"><span class="org">Scratch</span>, XSS in Cloud Logs</a></li>
      <li><a href="./posts/scratch-csrf.html"><span class="org">Scratch</span>, CSRF in Cloud Data</a></li>
      <li><a href="./posts/scratch-csrf.html"><span class="org">Firefly</span>, Open Redirect [duplicate]</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A lot of vulnerabilities I find don't have a write-up associated with them. I've currently reported</p><div class="big">21</div><p>vulnerabilities, including one in <span class="org">Microsoft</span>.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about any of the above write-ups, I'd love to help out. Feel free to file an issue to ask a question.</p>
