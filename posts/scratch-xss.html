<h1>XSS in Scratch</h1>
 <article>
 <p>I found a stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Scratch's Cloud Log system. I initially found two points where text wasn't filtered; the column in the table where the value of the cloud variable is rendered, and the hover text which comes with it. However, the actual text in the table is shortened, with its middle replaced with an ellipsis. That makes code injection impractical; but perhaps not impossible if one combines multiple rows in the table.</p> 
 <p>However, the more viable injection point is the title attribute which defines the hover text for this data. The hover text has <em>all</em> of the cloud variable's value, and so if one sets the cloud variable to <code>"&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.domain)&lt;/script&gt;</code>, then an alert box will show up, because the <code>title</code> attribute is closed by the <code>"</code>, and its tag is closed with the <code>&gt;</code>. Afterwards, the script tag can take over an account; but instead it just showed an annoying alert box, just to prove the vulnerability was there.</p>
 <p>The time now was approaching midnight, but I decided to report the vulnerability immediately given the potentially high impact (the code can do anything a human can do when they're logged in). I'm glad I did, Scratch fixed the vulnerability very quickly, and were very transparent throughout the process. The vulnerability was gone within three days of my report.</p>
